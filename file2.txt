The Lost Key

Emma was rushing home when she realized her house key was missing. Panic filled her chest as she searched her pockets and bag. The sun was setting, and the cold wind whispered through the trees. She retraced her steps, hoping to find it.

Then, a soft jingling sound caught her attention. A little boy stood nearby, holding up her key with a smile. "Is this yours?" he asked.

Relieved, Emma nodded and thanked him. "You're my hero!" she laughed.

The boy grinned and ran off. That night, Emma promised to always keep her keys in a safer place.
